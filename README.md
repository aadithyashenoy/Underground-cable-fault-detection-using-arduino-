# Cable Fault Detection Project

## Overview
Cable fault detection is a crucial task in maintaining and optimizing the performance of power transmission and distribution systems. This project focuses on determining the distance from the base station to the cable fault location using the principles of Ohmâ€™s law. The detected fault location is displayed on an LCD screen.

## Features
- Detects short circuit and open circuit faults.
- Displays the exact fault location in kilometers.
- Cost-effective and customizable solution.
- Suitable for both professional and educational purposes.

## Introduction
This project is developed to address the challenges posed by cable faults in power transmission and distribution systems. Faults can be caused by insulation deterioration, mechanical damage, or environmental factors, leading to system inefficiencies and power outages. The traditional methods of fault detection are time-consuming and often unreliable. This project aims to provide a more efficient and accurate solution.

## Installation
To get started with this project, clone the repository and set up the necessary hardware components.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cable-fault-detection.git
